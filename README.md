# Java Programming Repository

Welcome to the **Java Programming Repository**! This repository is a collection of Java programs demonstrating various concepts of Java programming, ranging from basic syntax to advanced topics. Each program is well-structured and designed to help learners understand the fundamentals and applications of Java.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following directories and files for ease of navigation:

### Main Directory
- `src/` - Contains all the source code files categorized by topics.

### `src` Directory

The `src` folder is divided into subfolders based on Java concepts. Below is the detailed structure of the directory:

1. **Basic Concepts**
   - `HelloWorld.java` - A simple program to print "Hello, World!" to the console.
   - `DataTypes.java` - Demonstrates the use of different data types in Java.
   - `ControlStatements.java` - Examples of `if`, `else`, `switch`, `for`, `while`, and `do-while` statements.

2. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
   - `ClassesAndObjects.java` - Explains the creation and usage of classes and objects.
   - `InheritanceDemo.java` - Illustrates single and multilevel inheritance.
   - `PolymorphismExample.java` - Demonstrates method overloading and overriding.
   - `EncapsulationDemo.java` - Example of encapsulation with getters and setters.

3. **Advanced Concepts**
   - `CollectionsDemo.java` - Shows the use of Java collections like ArrayList, HashMap, and LinkedList.
   - `Multithreading.java` - Demonstrates the creation and management of threads.
   - `FileHandling.java` - Provides examples of reading from and writing to files.

4. **Data Structures**
   - `StackImplementation.java` - Implements a stack using arrays.
   - `QueueImplementation.java` - Implements a queue using arrays.
   - `LinkedListDemo.java` - Demonstrates the use of linked lists.

5. **Algorithms**
   - `SortingAlgorithms.java` - Implements bubble sort, selection sort, and quicksort.
   - `SearchAlgorithms.java` - Demonstrates linear search and binary search.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Ensure that you have Java installed on your system. You can download it from [Oracle's Java Download Page](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html).
- A Java IDE or text editor such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or Visual Studio Code is recommended for running the programs.
